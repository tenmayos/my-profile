            <p>Getting right to the point, here is yet another list of the things I can do</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Assemble computer hardware
                </li>
                <li>
                    Git and version control
                </li>
                <li>
                    Docker
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bash & PowerShell
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ubuntu OS
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>During my path it was rather natural for me to pick up the more modern skills that go with software development,
                in order to both make my life easier and speed up my development pace.</p>
            <p>As for the Assembly of computer hardware, this was just me and my curiosity.</p>
