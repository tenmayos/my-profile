            <p>Born in Egypt and mostly raised there despite having a Saudi Arabian nationality.</p>
            <p>
                I started using computers and playing video games at a very young age.</p>
            <p>Ever since then it has been a childhood dream for me to create my own game.</p>
            <p>
                And that is where it all began, where the source of my motivation was born, and through it I started learning programming.
                Starting with C# only to find out that there is much more where that came from. Right after C# and high school I started looking into other languages and programming paradigms.
                I tried to learn whatever my eyes fell upon, like I'm in a supermarket and the goods are just all good. However, because I was teaching myself,
                the resources and the progress I was making didn't blend well with my liking. Thus I considered a different approach of learning one thing that can be applied to all,
                and that turned out to be problem solving!
                It is the foundational skill that everything else just builds upon, and thus it was my target.
                After that learning new programming languages was only a matter of syntax and my growing pace sped up tremendously.
                Right after that I decided to teach some of my interested friends in college.
                Satisfied with the results, I decided to do what anyone else would do.
                I would take those skills to the real world and use them to solve actual problems. Whether they were my own or of those close to me.
                Building small WPF apps to keep track of store inventories and such was one of the things that I did. But of course,
                I had to link my skills to the gaming world somehow, so I built a few game hacks/trainers but we shouldn't talk about those here!
