                <p>Born in Egypt and mostly raised there despite having a Saudi Arabian nationality.</p>
                <p>
                    I started using computers and playing video games at a very young age.</p>
                <p>Ever since then it has been a childhood dream for me to create my own game.</p>
                <p>And that is where it all began, where the source of my motivation was born, and through it I started learning programming.
                    Starting with <strong style={{ "color": "#96e2f0" }}>C#</strong> only to find out that there is much more where that came from.
                </p>
                <p>Leading me to believe that when utilized correctly, logic and software can seem like magic!</p>
                <p>And this is what drives me on, to help people build the web or desktop apps of their dreams, moving them on forward!</p>
                <p><strong>I'm Bassam Saleh</strong>, and I will stop at nothing to build your projects or solve any technical issues.</p>
